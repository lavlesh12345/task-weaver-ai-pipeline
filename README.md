### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-function-pipeline
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Open your browser**
Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## üí° How to Use

### Basic Query Processing

1. **Enter a Natural Language Query**
   - Type your request in plain English
   - Example: "Retrieve all invoices for March, calculate the total amount, and send a summary email"

2. **Process the Query**
   - Click "Process" to analyze the query
   - The AI engine will generate an execution plan

3. **Review the Plan**
   - View the generated function sequence
   - Check dependencies and execution order
   - Review query analysis results

4. **Execute the Plan**
   - Click "Execute Plan" to run the functions
   - Monitor real-time progress
   - View execution results

### Example Queries

```
Business Operations:
- "Get all customers from California and send them a promotional email"
- "Retrieve sales data for Q1, analyze trends, and generate a quarterly report"
- "Find pending orders, update inventory, and notify customers of shipping delays"

Data Analysis:
- "Collect invoice data, calculate total revenue, and create a revenue chart"
- "Analyze customer data, segment by demographics, and export to CSV"
- "Get product sales data, identify top performers, and generate insights"

Automation:
- "Schedule weekly sales reports and email them to the management team"
- "Monitor inventory levels and automatically reorder low-stock items"
- "Process refunds for returned items and update customer accounts"
```

## üîß Architecture

### AI Pipeline Engine
The core of the system is the `AIPipelineEngine` class that handles:

- **Query Analysis**: Breaking down natural language into actionable components
- **Function Identification**: Mapping queries to relevant functions
- **Dependency Calculation**: Determining execution order and dependencies
- **Execution Planning**: Creating optimized execution plans
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of function execution

### Function Library
A comprehensive library of 50+ functions organized by category:

```typescript
interface FunctionDefinition {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  inputs: InputDefinition[];
  outputs: OutputDefinition[];
  example?: string;
}
```

### Execution Flow
1. **Query Input**: User enters natural language query
2. **Analysis**: AI engine analyzes intent and extracts entities
3. **Planning**: System generates function sequence with dependencies
4. **Execution**: Functions are executed in optimized order
5. **Results**: Outputs are displayed with full traceability
